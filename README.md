# Random Tiny Things
Scripts, tools, etc... written/made real quick to originally help myself or for fun

1. **Remind Script (remind.vbs):** This is a vb script which can be invoked with message and timeout, it'll show a message box with given message after given time interval

2. **Script to prevent computer from sleeping (keep-awake.bat):** This script doesn't let a computer sleep due to inactivity. This is useful when the changing power policy is disabled by administrator.

3. **Script to prevent bluetooth headset getting disconnected due to audio inactivity (beep-every-min.bat): ** This script beeps with default windows alert sound every one minute using **python**. This prevents my bluetooth headset from disconnecting (going into power saving mode) due to lack of audio output for few minutes.
