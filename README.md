# Random Tiny Things
Scripts, tools, etc... written/made real quick to originally help myself or for fun

#### Remind Script
**remind.vbs** is a vb script which can be invoked with message and timeout, it'll show a message box with given message after given time interval

#### Script to prevent computer from sleeping
**keep-awake.bat** is a script which doesn't let a computer sleep due to inactivity. This is useful when the changing power policy is disabled by administrator.

#### Script to prevent bluetooth headset getting disconnected due to audio inactivity 
**beep-every-min.bat** is a script which beeps with default windows alert sound every one minute using python. This prevents my bluetooth headset from disconnecting (going into power saving mode) due to lack of audio output for few minutes.
